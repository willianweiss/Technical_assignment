## Prerequisites

- Docker (for running the application using a container)
- Make (optional, for simplified command execution)

## Installation and Setup

### Running with Docker using Make

1. **Build the Docker Image**
   Use this command to build the Docker image for the application:
make build

2. **Run the Application**
To run the application using a list of URLs from a file called `websites.txt`, use the following command:
make run

### Alternative Commands

- **Access Bash Inside the Container**
If you need to access the bash shell inside the container for debugging or manual testing, use this command:
make bash

- **Stop Running Containers**
To stop all containers associated with this application, you can use:
make down

- **Clean up Docker**
To remove all containers, unused images, and networks associated with the application, use:

## Usage

After building the image, you can run the application using the `make run` command. Make sure your `websites.txt` file is properly formatted with one URL per line. The results will be printed in JSON format directly to your console.
